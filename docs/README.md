# Travel DNA documentation

This directory contains the stable product, architecture, engineering and
teaching documentation for Travel DNA.

## Main areas

- [`it/`](it/README.md): Italian book-like product and engineering chapters.
- [`it/lab/`](it/lab/README.md): executable and planned teaching scenarios.
- [`adr/`](adr/README.md): Architecture Decision Records.
- [`project/`](project/README.md): live development state and foundation records.
- [`project/daily/`](project/daily/README.md): permanent index of daily reports.
- [`commenting-style.md`](commenting-style.md): source-comment rules.
- [`commenting-status.md`](commenting-status.md): current review state.

## Implementation-backed learning sequence

1. [`43-reference-routing-java-rust.md`](it/43-reference-routing-java-rust.md):
   graph, Dijkstra, A* and independent Java/Rust reports.
2. [`44-contratti-routing-e-fake-provider.md`](it/44-contratti-routing-e-fake-provider.md):
   provider-neutral routing contracts and deterministic fake planner.
3. [`45-map-scene-e-fake-renderer.md`](it/45-map-scene-e-fake-renderer.md):
   declarative map scene, bounded deltas and semantic fake renderer.
4. [`46-location-sample-e-replay-deterministico.md`](it/46-location-sample-e-replay-deterministico.md):
   monotonic samples, ordering gate, virtual clock and replay.
5. [`47-posizione-matched-e-route-progress.md`](it/47-posizione-matched-e-route-progress.md):
   already-matched positions, route progress, maneuver/arrival policy and map delta.

Run all foundation checks:

```bash
sh tools/tdna check
```

Run individual Labs:

```bash
sh tools/tdna lab reference-routing dijkstra
sh tools/tdna lab routing-contracts
sh tools/tdna lab map-scene
sh tools/tdna lab location-replay
sh tools/tdna lab route-progress
```

Hand-written documentation remains the primary explanation. Generated reports,
benchmarks and graphs stay in recognizable generated paths and never replace the
narrative source.
